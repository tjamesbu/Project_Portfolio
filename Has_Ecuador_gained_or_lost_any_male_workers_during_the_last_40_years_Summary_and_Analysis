The analysis conducted provided a graph displaying the amount of males living, and we assume working, in Ecuador from 1960 - 2019.  
The three age ranges that were observed were 75-79 years, 50-54 years, 15-64 years, and 00-04 years.  We assumed that most of the males capable of performing work fell
in the age range of 15-64 years and that there has been little change in the population of males working in Ecuador during the last 40 years. 

The graph shows us that there has been a steady slight increase in the population of Ecuadorian males ages 15-64, but there has been little to no change in the population 
of males ages 00-04.  We can conclude from this data that there has been little to no change in the overall population of males, and the increase in the population of males 
ages 15-64 is due to the constant rate of births that have continued steadily during the past 40 years.  Further analysis could be conducted by observing the population changes
in females during the past 40 years, for females in some societies have a higher chance of being born versus males.  

Truthfulness is in the data sources.  Data was obtained from the United Nations and WorldBank, both governmental institutions.  

Beauty is in the simplicity of the graph produced for this analysis.  Not too many complications or details were added in to provide a simpler and more beautiful analysis 
for the viewer.

Functionality is in the source code which you can observe further using the link below.

Insightfulness is in the interpretations of the data.  Data from multiple age-ranges was used to provide further insight and analysis in answering the research question.  
These multiple interpretations were then used to create insight as to whether or not Ecuador has seen any changes in their male population growth during the last 40 years.
