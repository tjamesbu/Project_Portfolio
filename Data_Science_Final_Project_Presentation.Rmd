What Is This About ?!

<b>It's tough to predict the future but not words!</b>

Applications derived from `word based statistical model` has helped improve mankind's quality of life.

For examples,

1. [<b>SwiftKey Keyboard</b>](https://swiftkey.com/en) predicts the next word (as user types) that makes compostion task on mobile a breeze!
2. [<b>Text-To-Speech Synthesize</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) assists in speech construction when challenged by disability and breaks down physical communication boundaries. (E.g. Stephen Hawking)

How It Works ?

The `High Level Architecture` as below,

`Markov Chain Model` represents each word as transitional state with probability. An intuitive example, word "B" has 30% chance to transit to word "A".

`Add-1 Smoothing` is applied to distribute probability mass to produce a less-biased prediction model.

What's Next ?

The prediction model is somewhat skewed. Possible improvements are,

1. Increase Corpus size and/or type.
2. Increase machine resources - create more complex model.
3. Increase Shiny io resources - host more complex text prediction application.
